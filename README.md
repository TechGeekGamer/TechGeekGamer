### Hello World! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Daniel. I'm in High School and like to code things in my free time. I work on random projects most of the time, look below for the projects I do:

## BanSync
BanSync is a Discord bot that keeps tracks of the reasons a user was banned. This may be helpful when wanting to know if someone might cause problems in your server, or if you're looking to hire someone as a mod.

## SlashNotes
SlashNotes is a basic bot that you can use to store notes using Discord's Slash Commands UI.

### Commands

**delete**: Delete a note

**list**: View all notes you have made

**post**: Share a note you made in the current channel

**view**: View a note

### Notes
- The Manage Server permission is required to manage Server Slash notes. (Notes that can be seen by everyone in the server through the Slash Commands menu.)

- Due to Discord's limits on Slash Commands, you can only have up to 50 Server Slash notes.

- Due to Discord's limits, Slash Commands won't appear in servers with more than 50 bots.
